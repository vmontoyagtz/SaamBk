Think of  a package delivery system. When a package is sent, it goes through various stages in the delivery pipeline, such as being sorted, loaded onto a truck, transported to a distribution center, and ultimately delivered to the recipient.
In this analogy, each stage in the pipeline represents a pipeline behavior, with each behavior performing a specific action on the package, such as checking for proper labeling, ensuring that the package is in the correct location, or verifying the recipient's identity before delivery.
Just like how pipeline behaviors can be added, removed, or modified in a package delivery system to improve the delivery process, pipeline behaviors in MediatR can be added, removed, or modified to enhance the processing of requests and responses in an application.
The IPipelineBehavior interface is a part of the MediatR library and allows developers to add custom behavior to the request pipeline. Essentially, it is a middleware interface that can be used to perform actions before or after a request is handled by a handler.
To use the IPipelineBehavior interface, you need to implement it in a class that contains the custom behavior you want to add to the pipeline. The interface requires a Task-returning Handle method that takes two arguments: the request being processed and a RequestHandlerDelegate that represents the next handler in the pipeline.
When a request is processed, MediatR will iterate through all of the registered IPipelineBehavior instances in the order they were registered and call their Handle methods. The RequestHandlerDelegate parameter passed to each method allows the next handler in the pipeline to be called. The behavior class can execute custom logic before or after the call to the next handler.
The IPipelineBehavior interface can be used for a variety of purposes, such as logging, error handling, caching, and more. It allows developers to encapsulate custom logic and easily inject it into the pipeline.
