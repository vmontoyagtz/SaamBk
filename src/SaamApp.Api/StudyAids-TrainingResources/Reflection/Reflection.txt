In C#, there is a block called Assembly which is automatically generated by the compiler after the successful compilation of code. It consists of two parts: intermediate language and metadata.
When we write C# code, it is not directly compiled into machine-level language. It is first compiled into an intermediate language which is packaged into assembly.
Reflection is a powerful tool in C# that allows developers to inspect and manipulate the metadata in an assembly at runtime. By using reflection, developers can dynamically discover and load types, access and modify object instances, and invoke methods at runtime. This provides a lot of flexibility in how applications can be designed and implemented.
One common use case for reflection is in building extensible applications that can load and use plugins or modules at runtime. By inspecting the metadata of the plugin assembly, the application can discover the types and methods available in the plugin and use them as needed. Reflection also enables developers to create dynamic proxies for objects, which can be useful in implementing features such as caching or logging.
