The an anti-corruption layer between your old ASP.NET 4.7 application and a new microservice built with ASP.NET Core 7, to translate and insulate between the two systems' different models and communication patterns. While there might not be a ready-to-use open-source solution for your specific scenario, I can suggest an approach you can follow to create your own anti-corruption layer.
Create a shared contract: Define a shared contract between your new microservice and the anti-corruption layer. This contract should be based on your new microservice's domain model and should not be influenced by the legacy system's model. You can use an Interface to define the contract.
Implement the adapter pattern: To communicate with the legacy system and translate between the old and new models, you can implement the adapter pattern. Create a class that implements the shared contract (interface) and translates the requests and responses between the new microservice and the legacy system.
Abstract legacy system communication: Encapsulate the legacy system's communication logic, such as API calls or database access, within the adapter class. This way, your new microservice won't directly interact with the legacy system, making it easier to maintain and modify.
Map between old and new models: In the adapter class, implement the required mapping and translation logic between the legacy system's models and your new microservice's models. You can use a mapping library like AutoMapper to simplify this task.
Simplify the API: If the legacy system's API is complex or inconsistent, you can use the facade pattern to provide a simplified and consistent interface for your new microservice to interact with. This facade can be implemented within the adapter class or as a separate component in the anti-corruption layer.
Apply the dependency inversion principle: Inject the shared contract (interface) into your new microservice, so it depends on abstractions and not on concrete implementations. This makes it easier to replace or modify the anti-corruption layer in the future.
By following this approach, you can create a custom anti-corruption layer tailored to your specific scenario. This layer will translate between the different models and communication patterns of your old and new systems, insulating your new microservice from the legacy system's intricacies.
