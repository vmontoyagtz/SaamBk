Security and authentication: 
The Context Object can be used to provide a way for the domain layer to interact 
with security and authentication mechanisms, such as user authentication and authorization.
For example, the Context Object might define methods such as AuthenticateUser(string username,
string password) and AuthorizeUser(User user, string permission). The domain layer can then call
these methods to authenticate and authorize users as needed. This helps to ensure that the domain
layer does not need to have knowledge of the specific security mechanisms being used, and can focus
on its core responsibilities.
External integrations: The Context Object can also be used to provide a way for the domain
layer to interact with external systems and services, such as payment gateways, shipping providers,
and social media platforms. 
For example, the Context Object might define methods such as 
ChargePayment(Payment payment, CreditCard creditCard) and 
PostToSocialMedia(string message, string[] hashtags). 
The domain layer can then call these methods to perform 
the necessary integrations with external systems. 
By encapsulating these integrations within the Context Object, 
the domain layer can remain focused on its core responsibilities, 
and can more easily be tested and maintained.
Caching: The Context Object can be used to provide a way for the domain layer to
interact with caching mechanisms, such as in-memory or distributed caches.
For example, the Context Object might define methods such as 
GetFromCache(string key) and AddToCache(string key, object value). 
The domain layer can then call these methods to store and retrieve 
data from the cache. By using a Context Object to interact with the cache,
the domain layer can remain agnostic to the specific caching mechanism being used,
and can more easily be tested and maintained.
Messaging: The Context Object can be used to provide a way for the domain
layer to interact with messaging systems, such as message brokers or event buses.
For example, the Context Object might define methods such as 
SendMessage(Message message) and SubscribeToTopic(string topic, Action<Message> handler).
The domain layer can then call these methods to send and receive messages. 
By encapsulating these messaging interactions within the Context Object, 
the domain layer can remain focused on its core responsibilities, 
and can more easily be tested and maintained.
Logging: The Context Object can be used to provide a way for the domain layer to interact with logging mechanisms,
such as log files or log aggregators. 
For example, the Context Object might define methods such 
as LogInfo(string message) and LogError(Exception ex). 
The domain layer can then call these methods to log messages and errors as needed.
By using a Context Object to interact with the logging mechanism, 
the domain layer can remain agnostic to the specific logging implementation
being used, and can more easily be tested and maintained.
Performance monitoring: The Context Object can be used to provide a way for the domain
layer to interact with performance monitoring tools, 
such as APM (Application Performance Monitoring) systems. 
For example, the Context Object might define methods such as 
StartTransaction(string transactionName) and EndTransaction(string transactionName). 
The domain layer can then call these methods to start and end performance monitoring 
transactions as needed. By encapsulating these performance monitoring interactions 
within the Context Object, the domain layer can remain focused on its core responsibilities, 
and can more easily be tested and maintained.
