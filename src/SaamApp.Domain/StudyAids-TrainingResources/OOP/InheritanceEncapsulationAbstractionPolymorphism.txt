Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the practice of hiding implementation details of an object from the outside world and instead presenting a public interface that other objects can interact with. This is achieved by declaring data members as private and providing access to them through public methods or properties.
Abstraction: Abstraction is the practice of focusing on the essential features of an object or system while ignoring the irrelevant details. This is done by creating abstract classes or interfaces that define the essential properties and behaviors that all objects in a certain domain should have, without specifying the details of how those properties and behaviors are implemented.
Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of objects of different types to be treated as if they were the same type. This allows for greater flexibility in programming, as it allows different objects to be used interchangeably in the same code. Polymorphism can be achieved through inheritance or interfaces, where objects of different classes can be treated as if they were of the same type if they share the same interface or inherit from the same base class.
Encapsulation:
Encapsulation is a mechanism that allows objects to protect their data and behavior from external access and modification. In other words, it is a way to restrict access to the internal state of an object and only allow it to be modified through defined methods or functions. Encapsulation helps to ensure the integrity of the data and the consistency of the behavior of the object.
Abstraction:
Abstraction is the process of reducing complexity by hiding unnecessary details while highlighting essential features. In programming, abstraction is achieved by defining interfaces that define the essential behavior of an object or system, without revealing the implementation details. Abstraction helps to create a simplified and generalized view of the system, making it easier to understand and use.
Polymorphism:
Polymorphism is the ability of objects of different types to be treated as if they were of the same type. It allows for the same interface or method to be used with different types of objects, providing a flexible and extensible design. Polymorphism can be achieved through inheritance or interfaces, where different classes can implement the same interface or inherit from the same base class, and have different behaviors for the same method or property. Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming and is widely used in software design patterns.
Inheritance: In .NET 7, inheritance is achieved through the use of classes and interfaces. A class can inherit the properties and behavior of another class using the "extends" keyword. This allows a class to reuse code from a parent class while adding additional functionality specific to the subclass. Additionally, interfaces can be used to define a set of methods that a class must implement, allowing for multiple inheritance of behavior.
Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the idea of hiding internal implementation details of a class and exposing a public interface for interacting with it. In .NET 7, this can be achieved through the use of access modifiers such as "public," "private," "protected," and "internal." These modifiers can be used to control the visibility of a class's members and ensure that only the intended parts of the class are accessible to other parts of the program.
Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of creating a simplified view of a complex system. In .NET 7, this can be achieved through the use of abstract classes and interfaces. An abstract class defines a set of properties and methods that must be implemented by any subclass, allowing for a common interface to be shared among multiple classes. Interfaces provide a way to define a set of methods that must be implemented by any class that uses the interface, allowing for a common interface to be shared among multiple unrelated classes.
Polymorphism: Polymorphism refers to the ability of a class to take on multiple forms or behave in different ways depending on the context in which it is used. In .NET 7, this can be achieved through the use of virtual and override keywords. A virtual method is a method that can be overridden by a subclass, allowing for different behavior to be implemented depending on the subclass. The override keyword is used to indicate that a method in a subclass is overriding a virtual method in the parent class, allowing for polymorphic behavior to be achieved.
Inheritance: Imagine you have a toy car that can move forward and backward. Now, you want to create a new toy car that can do the same thing, but it also has a horn that can beep. Instead of creating a new toy car from scratch, you can create a new one that "inherits" the features of the first toy car, like the ability to move forward and backward, and add the new feature of a horn. This is like having a parent car and a child car that inherits some of its traits from the parent.
Encapsulation: Encapsulation means hiding the details of how something works so that you can use it without worrying about how it works. For example, when you use a TV remote control, you don't need to know how the TV works internally. You only need to know how to use the remote control to change channels, adjust the volume, etc. This is like putting the complicated parts of something in a box, and only letting you interact with the parts that you need.
Abstraction: Abstraction is like using simple words or ideas to represent complex things. For example, when you see a stop sign, you know that you need to stop your bike or car. You don't need to know all the rules and reasons behind why you need to stop. Abstraction helps us simplify complex things so that we can understand them more easily.
Polymorphism: Polymorphism means having many forms. Imagine you have a toy car, a toy truck, and a toy airplane. Even though they are different toys, they all have wheels and can move forward and backward. This is like having many different objects that can behave in similar ways, even though they are different.
