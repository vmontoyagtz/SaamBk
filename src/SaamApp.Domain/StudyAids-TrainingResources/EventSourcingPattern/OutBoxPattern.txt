The Outbox Pattern is a design pattern that is used to ensure reliable message delivery in distributed systems.
It is based on the idea of using an outbox to temporarily store messages that need to be sent to an external system. The outbox is a database table that acts as a buffer between the application and the external system. Whenever the application needs to send a message to the external system, it adds the message to the outbox table. A separate process then reads the messages from the outbox table and sends them to the external system. This approach ensures that messages are never lost and are always delivered, even in the event of system failures or network outages.
