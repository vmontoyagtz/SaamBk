Domain Events and Integration Events are two types of events in a distributed system that serve different purposes.
Domain Events are events that are raised within a single microservice to signal that something has
happened in that microservice that other parts of the same microservice should be aware of.
They are part of the ubiquitous language of the domain and represent changes in the domain model.
Domain Events are typically handled synchronously within the same transaction that generates them,
and they are not published to external systems.
Integration Events, on the other hand, are messages that are sent between microservices or external
systems to signal that something has happened in a microservice that other microservices or external
systems should be aware of. They are used for out-of-process communication and enable loosely coupled
communication between different systems in a distributed architecture. Integration Events are typically
published asynchronously to an external message broker or event bus and can be handled by multiple subscribers.
In summary, Domain Events are used for intra-service communication within a single microservice,
while Integration Events are used for inter-service communication between multiple microservices
or external systems.
In a microservices architecture, different microservices typically communicate with each other through messages.
These messages can represent various types of interactions, such as commands, queries, or events.
When a microservice generates a domain event, it may need to communicate this event to other
microservices or external systems that are interested in this event. This is where Integration
Events come into play.
Integration Events are messages that represent events that have occurred in one microservice
and need to be communicated to other microservices or external systems. They enable loosely
coupled communication between different systems in a distributed architecture.
When a domain event is generated, it should be handled by the corresponding domain event
handler. If this domain event needs to be communicated to other microservices or external
systems, the domain event handler should send an Integration Event representing this domain event.
The Integration Event can then be published to an external message broker or event bus,
such as RabbitMQ or Kafka. Other microservices or external systems can subscribe to the
Integration Event and receive notifications when the event occurs.
It's important to note that Integration Events should be published only after all Domain
Events have finished executing and saving all changes to the database. This ensures that
the state of the system is consistent across all microservices and external systems.
To handle Integration Events in microservices, patterns like Transactional Outbox,
Change Data Capture, Sagas, or Process Manager can be used to maintain eventual consistency.
In summary, Integration Events are messages that represent domain events that need to be communicated
to other microservices or external systems. They enable loosely coupled communication between
different systems in a distributed architecture, and should be published only after all Domain
Events have finished executing and saving all changes to the database.
Integration events are messages that represent communications between different services or
components of a distributed system. They are often used for out-of-process communication,
such as calling microservices or external APIs.
When an integration event is needed, it is the responsibility of the domain event handler
to send the integration event. This is because the domain event handler has access to all
the information required to generate the integration event. It is recommended that integration
events be published only after all domain events have finished executing and saving all changes
to the database. This ensures that the integration event is consistent with the latest state of the system.
To handle integration events in microservices, you may need to use an external message broker
or event bus, such as RabbitMQ or Kafka. Additionally, you may need to use patterns such as
Transactional Outbox, Change Data Capture, Sagas, or Process Managers to maintain eventual
consistency across the system.
The Transactional Outbox pattern involves storing outgoing messages in a database transactionally
with the domain events that generate them. These messages can then be sent by a separate process
outside the transaction, ensuring that the sending of the messages is atomic with respect to the
changes in the database.
The Change Data Capture pattern involves detecting changes in the database and generating events
based on those changes. This allows for integration events to be generated automatically based
on changes in the database.
Sagas and Process Managers are patterns that can be used to manage complex workflows or transactions
that involve multiple services. Sagas and Process Managers use a state machine to coordinate the
different services involved in the transaction, ensuring that the transaction is eventually consistent across all services.
The Event Sourcing pattern involves storing all changes to the system as events. These events
can then be used to reconstruct the current state of the system. Event Sourcing is useful for
systems that need to maintain an audit trail or have complex business rules that are difficult
to model with a traditional database schema.
