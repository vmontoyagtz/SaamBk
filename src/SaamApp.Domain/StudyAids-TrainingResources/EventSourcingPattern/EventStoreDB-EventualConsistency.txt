Eventual consistency is a property of distributed systems where all replicas converge to the same
state over time, even in the presence of concurrent updates. This means that updates made to a replica
will eventually propagate to all other replicas, but there is no guarantee about when this will happen.
Eventual consistency is often used in large-scale, distributed systems because it provides a high degree
of scalability and availability, allowing systems to function even in the face of network partitions and failures.
EventStoreDB is a database that is designed specifically for event sourcing, a pattern where changes
to the state of an application are captured as a sequence of immutable events. EventStoreDB provides
strong support for eventual consistency, making it a great choice for systems that require high
scalability and availability. Here are some reasons why EventStoreDB is better than MongoDB,
Kafka, and Cassandra for eventual consistency:
EventStoreDB has built-in support for event sourcing. This means that it provides tools and
functionality that make it easy to implement event sourcing patterns in your application.
This can make it easier to achieve eventual consistency because events are immutable and
can be easily propagated to all replicas.
EventStoreDB has a built-in distributed consensus algorithm called Raft. Raft is a widely-used
algorithm for achieving consensus in distributed systems, and it provides strong guarantees about
consistency and availability. Raft ensures that all replicas converge to the same state,
even in the presence of failures and network partitions.
EventStoreDB provides a powerful query engine that allows you to query events and aggregate
data in real-time. This means that you can get real-time insights into the state of your system,
even as it scales to handle large volumes of data.
EventStoreDB provides support for projections, which are essentially views on your event data.
Projections allow you to extract meaningful insights from your event data in real-time, making
it easier to understand the state of your system.
On the other hand, let's outline the pros and cons of each database:
MongoDB:
One of the main strengths of MongoDB is its scalability and strong ad hoc query support. 
However, when it comes to transactionality, document-based databases like MongoDB are not
as strong. Although MongoDB recently announced support for multi-document transactions, 
this new feature currently comes with some limitations. Additionally, there is no easy method
for pushing new events to clients to optimize performance for processing events.
Another challenge with MongoDB for Event Sourcing is generating sequence numbers for events.
Due to eventual consistency in the cluster, MongoDB has no cluster-wide ACID transactions,
which would be required to achieve the sequencing guarantee. While there are workarounds for
these problems, they may result in a similar position to that of relational stores.
MongoDB's schema-less storage makes it easy to save events, but when saving multiple
events at once to MongoDB, there are challenges. MongoDB natively only supports single
document transactions, meaning you can choose to save multiple events in a single
document or save multiple events into multiple documents. 
Both methods have their drawbacks: if you choose to save multiple events
in a single document, it increases the complexity when searching for all
events of a given entity. If you save multiple events into multiple documents,
you have to use the new multiple document transactions feature of MongoDB,
which can also increase complexity. Furthermore, MongoDB has no support for a
global sequence number, which means you need to implement a logic for that by
yourself to achieve a full sequential read of all events.
In summary, while MongoDB offers scalability and strong ad hoc query support,
its eventual consistency model and lack of cluster-wide ACID transactions can
make it challenging to implement Event Sourcing effectively. Therefore, it may
not be the best option for projects that rely heavily on this architectural pattern.
Pros: MongoDB is highly scalable and provides good support for distributed systems.
It also provides a powerful query language that is easy to use.
Cons: MongoDB does not provide strong support for eventual consistency, and it can
be difficult to implement in distributed systems. It also has some limitations in terms of data modeling and querying.
Pros and cons of Kafka:
Kafka is a distributed message processing and storage tool that is often mentioned
in the context of event sourcing due to its focus on handling data streams. However,
when it comes to eventual consistency, Kafka has some downsides.
If you use a single topic to store events in Kafka, you can perform a full sequential
read of all events, but you also have to do this if you want to read all events related
to a single entity. This can be a performance issue if you have a large number of entities.
To optimize reading events of a single entity, you can create a topic for each entity,
but then you have to restore the global order of events by yourself. This can be complex and time-consuming.
Another possibility is to use partitions for your topic, but this requires even distribution
of entities across partitions, and you need to write the partitioning function based on this,
which can be difficult and inefficient.
Additionally, if you use Kafka as an event store, you have to consider that anyone with access
to the Kafka instance can read the topics you are using to save your events. This can be a security concern.
Finally, using Kafka as an event store means ignoring a 
key rule of event sourcing applications: before you publish an event, you have to store it. With Kafka,
these steps are combined, so you cannot ensure the storing of an event before publishing it.
If your Kafka instance fails while you try to store and publish an event, it is lost,
and you will never know. This is a major issue when it comes to ensuring eventual consistency.
In summary, while Kafka has some strengths when it comes to processing and storing data streams,
it may not be the best option for ensuring eventual consistency in event sourcing applications.
Its focus on messages and partitions can create complexities and performance issues,
and its design may not be ideal for handling the reading and writing requirements of event data.
Pros: Kafka is a highly scalable distributed streaming platform that provides good 
support for event-driven architectures. It also provides good support for real-time
processing and analytics.
Cons: Kafka does not provide strong support for eventual consistency, and it can be
difficult to implement in distributed systems. It also has some limitations in terms of data modeling and querying.
 Cassandra:
 Cassandra is a highly scalable distributed NoSQL database that offers a high level of flexibility
 when it comes to consistency needs for both reads and writes. It was originally designed to handle
 large amounts of data across multiple commodity servers while providing high availability and fault
 tolerance. While it has a lot of strengths, there are some significant limitations when
 it comes to using Cassandra as an event store for event-sourced systems.
One of the major challenges with Cassandra as an event store is ensuring sequencing numbering
for events. In order to guarantee sequence ordering in Cassandra, you must utilize its lightweight
transaction feature, which comes with a considerable performance cost. According to the documentation,
the lightweight transaction feature should be used sparingly. This means that using Cassandra as
an event store can lead to significant performance degradation when appending events, which is a
common operation in event-sourced systems.
Another limitation of Cassandra is its eventual consistency model, which can make it difficult to
ensure the accuracy of data in real-time. Eventual consistency is a feature of distributed systems
that allows for updates to be propagated across the system over time. This means that when data is
updated in one node of the system, it may not be immediately available in all other nodes.
While eventual consistency is a great feature for scalability, it can make it difficult 
to ensure the accuracy of data in real-time, which is critical for many event-sourced systems.
In addition to these limitations, Cassandra also requires careful tuning and configuration
to optimize its performance for event-sourced systems. This can be a complex and time-consuming
process, especially for teams that are new to Cassandra or event-sourced systems in general.
Overall, while Cassandra offers a lot of strengths when it comes to scalability and flexibility,
its limitations make it less than ideal as an event store for event-sourced systems.
Its lightweight transaction feature can lead to significant performance degradation when
appending events, and its eventual consistency model can make it difficult to ensure the
accuracy of data in real-time. As a result, teams looking to implement event-sourced systems
should carefully consider their options before choosing Cassandra as their event store.
Pros: Cassandra is highly scalable and provides good support for distributed systems.
It also provides good support for real-time processing and analytics.
Cons: Cassandra does not provide strong support for eventual consistency, and it can be
difficult to implement in distributed systems. It also has some limitations in terms of data modeling and querying.
In conclusion, EventStoreDB is a great choice for systems that require strong support
for eventual consistency. It provides a powerful query engine, support for event sourcing,
and a built-in distributed consensus algorithm. MongoDB, Kafka, and Cassandra are also good
choices for distributed systems, but they may not provide the same level of support for eventual consistency.
It's important to carefully consider the needs of your system when choosing a database, and to evaluate the pros and cons of each option.
