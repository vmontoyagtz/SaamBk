the Event Sourcing pattern and the Observer pattern are not the same, 
even though they can be used together in some scenarios.
Event Sourcing pattern:
The Event Sourcing pattern is a way of storing the state of an application as a
series of events that have occurred over time. Instead of storing the current state
of an object, the application records a sequence of events that describe changes to
the object's state over time. This makes it possible to replay the events to reconstruct
the object's state at any point in time.
An analogy for the Event Sourcing pattern could be a security camera that records a 
sequence of events over time. Instead of storing a snapshot of the current state of a room,
the camera records a sequence of events that show what happened in the room over time. 
This allows the security team to replay the footage to understand what happened in the 
room at any point in time, even if the current state of the room has changed.
Observer pattern:
The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, where changes to 
one object are automatically propagated to other objects that depend on it. 
When the state of the observed object changes, all its dependent objects are notified and updated automatically.
An analogy for the Observer pattern could be a sports game with spectators in the stands.
When one team scores a goal, the spectators on that team's side of the field cheer and celebrate,
while the spectators on the opposing team's side feel disappointed and dejected. 
The event of the goal being scored is propagated to all the spectators in the stands,
who react differently based on their individual preferences.
Difference:
The difference between the two patterns is that the Event Sourcing pattern 
is concerned with recording and replaying a sequence of events that describe changes 
to an object's state over time, while the Observer pattern is concerned with notifying 
and updating dependent objects automatically when the state of an observed object changes.
The Event Sourcing pattern is primarily used for auditing, analysis, or historical record-keeping, 
while the Observer pattern is used for real-time notifications and event-driven behavior.
The main differences between these patterns are:
Purpose: The Event Sourcing pattern is used to record and reconstruct
application state over time, while the Observer pattern is used to automatically notify dependent
objects of state changes.
Scope: Event Sourcing pattern is an architectural pattern that affects how an entire
application is designed and developed. The Observer pattern is focused on the relationship
between a subject and its observers.
Implementation: The Event Sourcing pattern involves
storing and retrieving event objects to recreate application state. The Observer pattern
uses the subject-observer relationship and event handling to notify observers of state changes.
