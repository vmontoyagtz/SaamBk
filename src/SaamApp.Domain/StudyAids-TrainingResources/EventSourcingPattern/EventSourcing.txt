the Event Sourcing pattern is a technique used to capture and persist the state of an application as a sequence of events.
Instead of storing the current state of an application in a database, the Event Sourcing pattern captures every change made to the application's state as a discrete event. Each event is then stored in a database in the order in which it occurred. By storing the application state as a sequence of events, the system can always recreate the current state of the application by replaying the events in order. This approach makes it easy to track changes to the application state and provides a complete audit trail of all changes made to the system.
