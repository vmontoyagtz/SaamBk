Supple Design: This is another term from "Domain-Driven Design" that refers to the practice of creating software designs that are flexible and adaptable to changing business requirements. The idea is to create a design that is resilient to change and can evolve over time, rather than being rigid and inflexible. 
Supple Design is a design approach that values flexibility and adaptability over rigid structure. It encourages a deep understanding of the problem domain and a focus on the most essential and valuable features. Supple design is not about avoiding complexity, but about managing it in a way that enables change and growth
Think of a gymnast performing a routine on a balance beam. The gymnast needs to be agile and flexible, able to adjust their movements based on the position of the beam and their own body. A supple design in software development is similar - it's flexible and adaptable, able to adjust to changing requirements and situations.
Imagine you're a chef who wants to create a new recipe. You have a general idea of what you want the dish to be, but you don't have a clear picture of all the ingredients and the exact measurements needed to make it perfect.
So, you start experimenting. You try different combinations of spices, herbs, and other ingredients until you find the right mix that makes your recipe delicious. You tweak the recipe until it's just right, adjusting the cooking time, temperature, and other variables to get the best flavor and texture.
In a similar way, Supple Design involves starting with a general idea of what you want your software to do, and then refining it through experimentation and iteration. You try different approaches, adjust the code, and refine the design until it's just right for your specific use case. It's a flexible, iterative approach that allows you to create software that is easy to change and maintain over time, much like a well-tuned recipe.
