Value Objects in domain-driven design are a way of encapsulating attributes and behaviors that can be moved out of the entity itself. They have no identity and are determined by their structural property, making them immutable. Value objects can be used as an attribute of entities and other valuable objects and explicitly defines and enforce important constraints (invariants). It should be modeled as a conceptual whole that carries meaning and upholds its constraints. An example is the Address, which is composed of multiple other values and can be modeled and treated as a Value Object with its own business logic.
Value Objects, as explained by Martin Fowler on his blog, are objects that represent a value, and are defined by their attributes rather than their identity. For example, a dollar amount or date range could be a Value Object. Value Objects provide many benefits, such as simplifying code, making it easier to reason about, and reducing bugs caused by the mutable state. They can also be used as building blocks to create more complex objects.
The "Value Object to the rescue" article explains how Value Objects can be used to improve code quality and make the domain model more expressive. It discusses how to create Value Objects, when to use them, and how they can help to reduce duplication in code. It also describes some common patterns and best practices for working with Value Objects.
The Value Object pattern is a way of creating objects that are small, immutable, and value-based. The pattern is useful for encapsulating data and behavior that are not closely tied to an object's identity. It provides a way to separate concerns and promote code reuse. The pattern is especially useful in situations where you need to represent complex data structures or encapsulate business rules.
