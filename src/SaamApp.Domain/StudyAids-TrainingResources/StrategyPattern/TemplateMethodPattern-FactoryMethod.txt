Factory Method Design Pattern:
The Factory Method design pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects,
but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that are created. This pattern is useful when you want
to decouple the creation of objects from the rest of the codebase, and when you want to make your code more
flexible and extensible. In the context of C# Clean Architecture, the Factory Method pattern can be used to
create objects that are used throughout the codebase, without tying the codebase to a specific class or implementation.
Analogy:
A real-life analogy for the Factory Method pattern could be a restaurant kitchen. The chef creates a menu
of dishes, but the kitchen staff prepares the dishes based on customer orders. The chef doesn't need to
know the specific details of how each dish is prepared, but they provide the recipes and ingredients for
the kitchen staff to follow. In this analogy, the chef is the creator class, the dishes are the products,
and the kitchen staff are the concrete creator subclasses.
Template Method Design Pattern:
The Template Method design pattern is a behavioral pattern that defines the steps of an algorithm,
but allows subclasses to override certain steps without changing the overall structure of the algorithm.
This pattern is useful when you want to define a common algorithm that is used by multiple classes,
but you want to allow some variation in the implementation of certain steps. In the context of C# Clean Architecture,
the Template Method pattern can be used to define the overall structure of an operation or process,
while allowing subclasses to customize specific steps in the process.
Analogy:
A real-life analogy for the Template Method pattern could be a construction project.
The architect creates a blueprint for the building, which outlines the overall structure and design.
However, the construction crew has some flexibility in how they execute the plan. For example,
they may choose different materials or construction techniques based on the specific site conditions.
In this analogy, the architect is the abstract class, the building is the final product,
and the construction crew are the concrete subclasses.
Differences:
The main difference between the Factory Method and Template Method patterns is that the Factory Method
pattern is used to create objects, while the Template Method pattern is used to define the steps of an algorithm.
The restaurant kitchen and construction project analogies illustrate this difference. In the restaurant kitchen,
the chef provides the recipe and ingredients for the kitchen staff to follow, which is analogous to the
Factory Method pattern. In the construction project, the architect provides the overall blueprint and design,
which is analogous to the Template Method pattern. In both patterns, subclasses can customize the implementation
to some degree, but the purpose and context of the patterns are different.
The main differences between these patterns are:
Purpose: The Template Method pattern is used to define the structure of an algorithm while allowing
for variations in its implementation. The Event Sourcing pattern is used to record and reconstruct
application state over time, while the Observer pattern is used to automatically notify dependent
objects of state changes.
Scope: The Template Method pattern is focused on a single class and its variations,
while the Event Sourcing pattern is an architectural pattern that affects how an entire
application is designed and developed. The Observer pattern is focused on the relationship
between a subject and its observers.
Implementation: The Template Method pattern uses inheritance and abstract methods to
define a structure for algorithm implementation. The Event Sourcing pattern involves
storing and retrieving event objects to recreate application state. The Observer pattern
uses the subject-observer relationship and event handling to notify observers of state changes.
