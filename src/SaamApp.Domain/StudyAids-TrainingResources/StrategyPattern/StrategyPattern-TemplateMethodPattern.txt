The Template Method pattern and the Strategy pattern are similar in that they both involve defining a family of algorithms,
but they differ in how they achieve flexibility and modularity in a system.
Template Method pattern:
The Template Method pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, 
but allows subclasses to override specific steps of the algorithm without changing
the overall structure. This allows the base class to define the overall flow of
the algorithm, while delegating the implementation of specific steps to the subclasses.
An analogy for the Template Method pattern could be a recipe for baking a cake.
The recipe provides a set of instructions for baking a cake, but allows for variation
in specific ingredients or steps. For example, the recipe might specify a basic batter
and baking time, but allow for variation in the type of frosting or decorations used on the cake.
Strategy pattern:
The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one,
and makes them interchangeable. This allows the client code to choose the
algorithm to use at runtime, based on the specific context or requirements.
An analogy for the Strategy pattern could be a transportation system with
different modes of transportation available, such as a car, train, or airplane.
The user can choose which mode of transportation to use based on their specific
needs or requirements, such as speed, cost, or distance.
Difference:
The difference between the two patterns is that the Template Method pattern
is concerned with defining a basic algorithm structure in a base class and
allowing subclasses to override specific steps of the algorithm, while the
Strategy pattern is concerned with defining a family of interchangeable algorithms
and allowing the client code to choose the appropriate algorithm at runtime.
The Template Method pattern focuses on code reuse and variation within a single algorithm,
while the Strategy pattern.
Purpose:
The purpose of the Template Method pattern is to define the basic steps of an algorithm
in a superclass while allowing subclasses to override some of the steps to provide
different behaviors, without changing the overall structure of the algorithm.
The purpose of the Strategy pattern is to encapsulate a family of related algorithms,
making them interchangeable at runtime. The pattern allows the algorithms to vary
independently from clients that use them.
Scope:
The Template Method pattern is typically used to define a general algorithm in a base
class, which can then be specialized by subclasses to implement specific variations of
the algorithm. The focus is on defining a common structure or skeleton of an algorithm
and letting the subclasses implement the specifics.
The Strategy pattern is typically used to allow clients to choose from a set of interchangeable
algorithms or strategies, which can be swapped in and out at runtime. The focus is on providing
a range of interchangeable algorithms that can be used as required.
Implementation:
The Template Method pattern is implemented by defining an abstract base class that provides the
basic algorithm, and one or more concrete subclasses that provide specific implementations for
some of the steps. The algorithm is typically structured as a sequence of method calls, where
some methods are left abstract and overridden by subclasses to provide specific behavior.
The Strategy pattern is implemented by defining an interface or abstract base class that
represents the family of algorithms, and concrete subclasses that implement specific strategies.
Clients use an instance of the interface to call the appropriate algorithm, which can be changed
at runtime by providing a different implementation of the interface.
In summary, the Template Method pattern is focused on defining a general algorithm and allowing
subclasses to specialize parts of the algorithm, while the Strategy pattern is focused on providing
a range of interchangeable algorithms that can be used as needed. The Template Method pattern is
typically used to provide a common structure for an algorithm, while the Strategy pattern is typically
used to encapsulate related algorithms and allow them to be swapped at runtime.
