An Anemic Model is a design pattern where entities are just plain data objects, lacking any behavior or business logic. They simply store and retrieve data from the database. It's important to note that some users may be confused, thinking that the POCO entity framework classes are problematic or old-fashioned. However, this is not the case.
POCO classes in the entity framework may seem like they have business logic and behavior, but they are primarily used for data storage and retrieval. They lack true encapsulation and validation. But in fact, they don't need it because their purpose is to transfer data. But In Clean Architecture, we use Domain-Driven Design entities, which have proper encapsulation and validation. These entities are separate from the entities used in the Entity Framework, which are used for data storage and retrieval. However, the Entity Framework only sees what it needs to see from the Domain-Driven Design entities. So the same class can be used.
To achieve this separation from POCO classes in the entity framework, we can use Fluent data annotation configuration for each entity. This configuration defines property names, data types, and other important information for data persistence and retrieval. The Fluent API provides a clear, concise, and type-safe way to configure the data model, defining the database schema, primary keys, foreign keys, and other information that Entity Framework needs to map tables to entities.
