The Application layer could be implemented using various design patterns, such as the Command-Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern or the Mediator pattern. In general, the Application layer would be composed of services and/or controllers that implement the business logic of the application.
The Application layer is responsible for implementing use cases and orchestrating domain objects. It interacts with the Presentation layer to receive user input and present results back to the user. Some examples of interactions between the Application and Presentation layers include:
The Presentation layer, on the other hand, could be implemented using various technologies such as Blazor Web Assembly, MVC, or Razor Pages. This layer would be responsible for handling user input, presenting data to the user, and providing a user interface for the application.
A user submits a login form through the Presentation layer. The Application layer receives the form data, validates it, and generates an authentication token. The token is then passed back to the Presentation layer, which stores it in the browser's local storage and uses it to authenticate subsequent requests.
A user clicks a "place order" button on a product page. The Presentation layer sends an HTTP request to the appropriate endpoint in the API. The Application layer receives the request, creates a new order object in the Domain layer, and saves it to the database. The Application layer then generates an email confirmation and sends it to the user through the Presentation layer.
The Presentation layer, on the other hand, is responsible for presenting information to the user and receiving user input. It typically consists of user interfaces such as web pages, mobile apps, or command-line interfaces. Some examples of interactions between the Presentation and Application layers include:
A user clicks a "search" button on a web page. The Presentation layer sends an HTTP request to the API, which is received by the Application layer. The Application layer searches the database for matching records and returns the results to the Presentation layer, which displays them on the web page.
A user enters a command into a command-line interface. The Presentation layer parses the command and sends it to the Application layer. The Application layer processes the command and sends the results back to the Presentation layer, which displays them in the terminal.
The Application layer and the Infrastructure layer are different in terms of their responsibilities and concerns.
The Application layer is responsible for implementing the use cases of the application, which involve coordinating the interaction between the Presentation layer and the Domain layer. The Application layer encapsulates the business logic of the application and defines the application services and use cases. It is focused on the behavior of the application and how it responds to user input.
On the other hand, the Infrastructure layer is responsible for providing the technical capabilities that the application needs to run. It is concerned with low-level technical details such as data storage, communication protocols, and system integration. The Infrastructure layer is typically made up of external libraries, frameworks, and services that the application depends on.
While the Application layer is focused on the behavior and logic of the application, the Infrastructure layer is focused on the technical details of how the application runs and communicates with other systems. These layers have different concerns and responsibilities, and separating them can help to maintain a clean and modular architecture that is easier to maintain and test.
The Application layer in Clean Architecture is responsible for implementing the use cases of the application and for coordinating the interaction between the Presentation layer and the Domain layer.
To implement use cases, the Application layer uses the services and entities defined in the Domain layer to perform the necessary actions and enforce the business rules. This layer acts as a mediator between the Presentation layer (where user interactions occur) and the Domain layer (where the core logic of the application resides).
To orchestrate domain objects, the Application layer uses the domain objects to perform the necessary actions required to complete the use cases. The Application layer can use the domain objects to execute various operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting data. It is responsible for ensuring that the use cases are executed correctly and the domain objects are in a valid state after the operations are performed.
Overall, the Application layer acts as a bridge between the Presentation and Domain layers, providing a higher-level view of the application's functionality while maintaining a separation of concerns between the layers.
Let's say you're building an e-commerce application. One of the use cases could be "place an order". The Application layer would be responsible for implementing this use case, which would involve coordinating the interaction between the Presentation layer (e.g., receiving the order details from the user) and the Domain layer (e.g., checking the availability of the items in the order, calculating the total cost, updating the inventory, etc.). The Application layer would also be responsible for notifying other parts of the application (e.g., sending an email confirmation to the customer) once the order has been successfully placed.
Another example could be a social networking application where users can follow each other. One of the use cases could be "show the activity feed". The Application layer would be responsible for retrieving the relevant data from the Domain layer (e.g., the posts, comments, and likes of the people the user follows) and formatting it appropriately for display in the Presentation layer (e.g., sorting the items by date, paginating the results, etc.). The Application layer would also be responsible for handling any errors or exceptions that might occur during the process.
In a banking application, one of the use cases could be "transfer funds between accounts". The Application layer would be responsible for coordinating the interaction between the Presentation layer (e.g., receiving the transfer details from the user) and the Domain layer (e.g., checking the balance of the source account, debiting the amount, checking the validity of the destination account, crediting the amount, updating the transaction history, etc.). The Application layer would also be responsible for enforcing any business rules or policies that might apply to the transfer (e.g., limits on the amount or frequency of transfers, fees, etc.).
A healthcare application that allows doctors to schedule appointments with patients. The Application layer would be responsible for coordinating the interaction between the Presentation layer (e.g., allowing the doctor to select a patient and date/time for the appointment) and the Domain layer (e.g., checking the availability of the doctor and the patient, reserving the appointment slot, sending appointment reminders, etc.). The Application layer would also be responsible for handling any errors or exceptions that might occur during the process.
A hotel booking application where users can search for and book rooms at various hotels. One of the use cases could be "search for available rooms". The Application layer would be responsible for retrieving the relevant data from the Domain layer (e.g., the list of available rooms and their prices) and formatting it appropriately for display in the Presentation layer (e.g., filtering the results by location, date, room type, etc.). The Application layer would also be responsible for handling any errors or exceptions that might occur during the search.
A fitness tracking application where users can log their workouts and track their progress. One of the use cases could be "create a new workout". The Application layer would be responsible for coordinating the interaction between the Presentation layer (e.g., allowing the user to select the type of workout, duration, intensity, etc.) and the Domain layer (e.g., creating a new workout record, updating the user's exercise history, calculating statistics and progress indicators, etc.). The Application layer would also be responsible for enforcing any constraints or rules that might apply to the workout (e.g., minimum duration or intensity, maximum frequency, etc.).
