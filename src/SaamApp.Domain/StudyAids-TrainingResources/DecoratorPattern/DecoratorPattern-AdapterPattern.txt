Adapter Design Pattern:
The Adapter design pattern is a structural pattern that allows two incompatible interfaces to work together.
This pattern is useful when you have an existing class or interface that you want to use in a new context,
but it doesn't match the required interface. In the context of C# Clean Architecture, the Adapter pattern
can be used to wrap an existing class or interface with a new interface that is compatible with the rest of the codebase.
Analogy:
A real-life analogy for the Adapter pattern could be a universal power adapter for electronic devices.
When you travel to a new country, the electrical outlets may be different, and your device's plug may not fit.
However, you can use a universal power adapter to connect your device to the foreign outlet.
The adapter acts as a bridge between the incompatible interfaces, allowing them to work together.
Decorator Design Pattern:
The Decorator design pattern is a structural pattern that allows you to add functionality
to an object at runtime, without changing its underlying structure. This pattern is useful
when you want to extend the behavior of an object without subclassing or modifying its code.
In the context of C# Clean Architecture, the Decorator pattern can be used to add functionality
to an object by wrapping it with one or more decorator objects.
Analogy:
A real-life analogy for the Decorator pattern could be a sandwich shop.
You can order a basic sandwich, such as a turkey sandwich with lettuce and tomato.
However, you can also add additional ingredients or toppings, such as bacon, avocado,
or cheese. Each additional ingredient enhances the basic sandwich, but it doesn't
fundamentally change its structure. In this analogy, the basic sandwich is the object,
and the additional ingredients are the decorator objects.
Differences:
The main difference between the Adapter and Decorator patterns is that the
Adapter pattern is used to make incompatible interfaces work together,
while the Decorator pattern is used to add functionality to an existing object.
The power adapter analogy illustrates the Adapter pattern, as it allows two incompatible interfaces
(the device plug and the foreign outlet) to work together. The sandwich shop analogy
illustrates the Decorator pattern, as it allows additional functionality (extra ingredients)
to be added to an existing object (the sandwich). In both patterns, a wrapper object is used
to provide the necessary functionality, but the purpose and context of the wrapper object are different.
