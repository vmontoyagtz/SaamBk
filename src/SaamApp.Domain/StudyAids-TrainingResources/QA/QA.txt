Which of the following is not a characteristic of a Domain-Driven Design (DDD)?
a) Encapsulation
b) Abstraction
c) Inheritance
d) Polymorphism
Answer: c) Inheritance
Inheritance is not a specific characteristic of Domain-Driven Design (DDD). DDD focuses on developing a model that represents the business domain and its concepts. Encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism are some of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles that can be applied to implement the DDD model. Inheritance is also an OOP principle, but it's not necessarily related to the DDD approach. Therefore, option c) is the correct answer.
