Static Classes: A static class is a class that cannot be instantiated and can only contain static members such as methods, fields, properties, and events. The members of a static class can be accessed using the class name without creating an instance of the class. static classes are commonly used to provide utility methods or constants that can be accessed throughout the application.
Static Classes: A static class is often used to provide utility functions that can be called from different parts of an application. For example, a MathHelper class might contain static methods such as CalculateArea() or CalculatePerimeter(), which can be called from different parts of the application without the need to create an instance of the class.
Another use case for a static class is to provide extension methods for existing classes or interfaces. For example, the StringExtensions class might define static methods that extend the String class, such as TrimToLength() or IsAllDigits().
Abstract Classes: An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and can only be used as a base class for other classes. An abstract class may contain abstract members such as methods, properties, and events, which have no implementation in the base class but must be implemented in the derived classes. abstract classes are commonly used to define a common interface for a group of related classes.
Abstract Classes: An abstract class is often used to define a common interface for a group of related classes. For example, an Animal class might be defined as an abstract class, with derived classes such as Cat, Dog, and Bird implementing the Animal interface.
Another use case for an abstract class is to provide a default implementation for a set of methods, while allowing derived classes to override those methods if needed. For example, an AbstractValidator class might provide a default implementation for the Validate() method, while allowing derived classes to override the Validate() method to implement custom validation logic.
Sealed Classes: A sealed class is a class that cannot be inherited and can only be used as a leaf class. sealed classes are commonly used to prevent further derivation of a class and to provide a secure implementation of a specific functionality.
Sealed Classes: A sealed class is often used to prevent further derivation of a class and to provide a secure implementation of a specific functionality. For example, a SecurityManager class might be defined as a sealed class to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data or resources.
Another use case for a sealed class is to provide a lightweight implementation of a data transfer object (DTO). For example, a PersonDto class might be defined as a sealed class that contains only properties that represent the person's name, address, and contact information.
Public Classes: A public class is a class that can be accessed from anywhere within the same assembly or from another assembly. public classes are commonly used to expose functionality that can be used by other parts of the application or by external applications.
Public Classes: A public class is often used to expose functionality that can be used by other parts of the application or by external applications. For example, a FileLoader class might be defined as a public class to allow other parts of the application to load files from disk.
Another use case for a public class is to define a top-level container for related classes or functions. For example, a Math class might contain static methods for common mathematical operations such as Add(), Subtract(), and Multiply().
Protected Internal Classes: A protected internal class is a class that can be accessed from within the same assembly or from a derived class in another assembly. protected internal classes are commonly used to provide functionality that can be used by other parts of the application or by derived classes in another assembly.
Protected Internal Classes: A protected internal class is often used to provide functionality that can be used by other parts of the application or by derived classes in another assembly. For example, a DataAccessManager class might be defined as a protected internal class to allow derived classes in another assembly to access the database.
Another use case for a protected internal class is to provide a base class that is used by multiple derived classes in the same assembly. For example, a DatabaseEntity class might be defined as a protected internal class that provides a common interface for entities that are persisted in the database.
Private Protected Classes: A private protected class is a class that can be accessed from within the same assembly by derived classes that are declared in the same assembly. private protected classes are commonly used to provide functionality that is accessible only by derived classes within the same assembly.
Private Protected Classes: A private protected class is often used to provide functionality that is accessible only by derived classes within the same assembly. For example, a DatabaseConnector class might be defined as a private protected class to allow derived classes in the same assembly to access the database.
Another use case for a private protected class is to provide a base class that is used by a set of related derived classes in the same assembly. For example, a Shape class might be defined as a private protected class that provides a common interface for shapes such as circles, rectangles, and triangles
Private Classes: A private class is a class that can only be accessed from within the same class or struct. private classes are commonly used to encapsulate functionality that is only used within a specific class or struct.
Private Classes: A private class is often used to encapsulate functionality that is only used within a specific class or struct. For example, a Node class might be defined as a private class to implement a binary tree data structure. The Node class is only used by the BinaryTree class, which is defined as a public class.
Another use case for a private class is to encapsulate implementation details that are used by a single class or struct. For example, a LinkedList class might define a private Node class to implement the linked list data structure.
