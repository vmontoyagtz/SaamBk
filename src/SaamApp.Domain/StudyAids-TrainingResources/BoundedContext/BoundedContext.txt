Bounded Context: This is a core concept in Domain-Driven Design that refers to the idea that the domain model of a software system should be divided into smaller, cohesive contexts. Each context has a specific responsibility and a clear boundary that separates it from other contexts. Within a bounded context, ubiquitous language and supple design principles apply.
Bounded Context is a boundary or border that separates different domains or subdomains within a larger system. Bounded contexts define clear boundaries and responsibilities, and facilitate communication and collaboration between teams. They are not just technical or architectural constructs, but also social and cultural ones, reflecting the different perspectives and priorities of various stakeholders.
Imagine a city with different neighborhoods, each with its own unique culture, architecture, and way of life. While each neighborhood is part of the larger city, it has distinct boundaries and characteristics. In software development, bounded contexts are similar - they represent specific areas of the software with their own set of rules, constraints, and vocabulary. Each bounded context is part of the larger system, but it has distinct boundaries and characteristics.
In Clean Architecture, bounded contexts are typically implemented as modules or layers of the system, with clear interfaces between them. By separating concerns and responsibilities in this way, the architecture becomes more flexible and easier to maintain and evolve.
We will meticulously and line by line in most cases examine each aspect in depth as we progress through the various sections of the application.
