The BaseEntityEv abstract class has the responsibility of defining the base properties and behaviors of all entities in the domain. This means that it has a single responsibility of providing a foundation for all domain entities.
The IAggregateRoot interface defines the contract for a class to be considered an aggregate root. An aggregate root is responsible for enforcing invariants and business rules for a cluster of objects that are bound together by a transactional boundary. This means that the interface has a single responsibility of defining what an aggregate root is and what responsibilities it has.
By inheriting from BaseEntityEv and implementing IAggregateRoot, the Customer entity class is adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle indirectly. It has the single responsibility of being a domain entity, while the BaseEntityEv and IAggregateRoot handle other responsibilities related to the domain.
Here are the SOLID principles used in this code:
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each class and method has only one responsibility.
Open/Closed Principle (OCP): The classes are open for extension but closed for modification. The class's behavior can be extended without modifying the class.
Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): The code uses inheritance to create a derived class (in this case, BaseEntityEv) that can substitute the base class (in this case, Guid) without affecting the program's correctness.
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): The interfaces contain the exact methods required for a specific task, and the code does not rely on unused methods.
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): The code follows DIP by depending on abstractions, such as interfaces, instead of concrete implementations. This approach enables the code to be more flexible and easier to change.
Regarding design patterns, this code uses the Guard Clause, which is a defensive coding pattern. This pattern is implemented using the Guard class provided by the Ardalis.GuardClauses library. The Guard class provides a set of static methods that verify a condition before executing a method, throwing an exception if the condition is not met. This approach eliminates the need for nested if statements, improving code readability, and maintainability.
