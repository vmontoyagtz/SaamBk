The Proxy Design Pattern provides a way to control access to an object by providing a surrogate or placeholder for it, which forwards requests to the real object only when necessary. This pattern is useful in situations where the object is expensive to create or access and needs to be cached to reduce performance impact.
    In the context of an application that uses DDD principles and the Clean Architecture, a possible use case for the Proxy Design Pattern could be to reduce the number of calls to the Customer entity, by creating a proxy object that caches the results of certain queries and avoids unnecessary database hits.
