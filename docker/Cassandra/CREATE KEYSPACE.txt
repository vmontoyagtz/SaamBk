tool. Here are the steps to create a keyspace:

First, open a terminal and run the following command to access the Cassandra container:

python
Copy code
docker exec -it cassandra cqlsh
This command will start a cqlsh session inside the running Cassandra container.

Now you can create a keyspace by running the following command:

sql
Copy code
CREATE KEYSPACE your_keyspace_name WITH REPLICATION = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': 1};
Replace your_keyspace_name with the desired keyspace name, and set the replication_factor according to your needs. For a single-node development setup, you can set the replication factor to 1.

Once the keyspace is created, you can use it by running:

Copy code
USE your_keyspace_name;
Replace your_keyspace_name with the name you used when creating the keyspace.

You can now create tables and execute other CQL commands within this keyspace.

To exit the cqlsh session, type exit and press Enter.
