Go to the "Sources" dropdown menu in the top navigation bar.
Select "Tables."
Click on the "+" button to add a new table.

Create a new chart.

Click on the "Charts" dropdown menu in the top navigation bar.
Select "Add chart."
Choose the datasource (the table you imported in step 2).
Configure your chart visualization and options as desired.
Create a new dashboard.

Click on the "Dashboards" dropdown menu in the top navigation bar.
Select "Add dashboard."
Give your dashboard a name and save it.
Add the chart you created to the dashboard.

Click on the "Edit dashboard" button on the dashboard you just created.
Click on the "+" button to add a new component.
