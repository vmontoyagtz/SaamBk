Create a new file named superset_config.py in the same directory as your docker-compose.yaml file.

Generate a new secure secret key using the suggested command: openssl rand -base64 42
Copy the output.

Add the following content to the superset_config.py file, replacing your_generated_secret_key with the key you generated in the previous step:

SECRET_KEY = 'your_generated_secret_key'
